# Samurai Frenchie NFT Ecosystem

**SamuraiFrenchieNFT** is a story-driven NFT + meme coin ecosystem set in a stylized samurai world mixed with modern crypto culture. The goal is to build a long-term brand and universe, not a one-and-done degen flip.

This repo hosts public documentation (and later, any relevant code) for the project.

## Project Overview

- **NFT Collection**  
  A curated collection of Samurai Frenchie characters, enemies, and allies set in a Japanese-inspired world.

- **Meme Coin**  
  A community-driven token that ties into the NFTs, lore, and future app.  
  Chain: **Base** (planned)

- **Future App (Duel/Game Concept)**  
  A light, gamified experience where holders and community members can battle, compete, and interact using their NFTs and the token.
