# Use of Funds (Public)

This document outlines how funds raised for the project will be allocated.  
The focus of this round is **building** – shipping product fast and clean – so
the majority of capital is directed to **development and an additional dev hire**.

Percentages are approximate and may shift slightly based on the final raise size.

---

## High-Level Allocation

- **60–70% — Core Development & Extra Dev**
- **10–15% — Infrastructure & Tools**
- **10–15% — Community, Marketing & Growth**
- **5–10% — Operations, Legal & Admin**
- **5% — Reserve / Buffer**

---

## 1. Core Development & Extra Dev (60–70%)

This is the largest part of the allocation.

**Goal:** Ship a stable, polished product faster by putting most of the funds
directly into build work.

**Covers:**

- Core developer(s) currently working on the product
- **Extra dev hire / additional engineering capacity** to speed up:
  - Core game/app features
  - Security and reliability improvements
  - UI/UX upgrades and polish
- Short-term specialist work (e.g. audits, architecture review, integrations)

This category is intentionally oversized compared to the others so that the
majority of the round directly accelerates shipping and iteration.

---

## 2. Infrastructure & Tools (10–15%)

Everything needed to keep the product live, fast, and testable.

**Covers:**

- Servers, hosting, and API costs
- Databases, monitoring, analytics
- Developer tools, testing environments, automation
- Third-party services tightly tied to the app’s performance

This is kept lean but sufficient to support live traffic and future scaling.

---

## 3. Community, Marketing & Growth (10–15%)

Still important, but minimized to make room for a larger dev allocation.

**Covers:**

- Community management support
- Launch campaigns and collaborations
- Graphics, branding assets, and content for announcements
- Targeted marketing experiments, not bloated ad spend

The focus here is **efficient** visibility, not burning capital on big,
unnecessary campaigns.

---

## 4. Operations, Legal & Admin (5–10%)

Only what’s necessary to run things cleanly and compliantly.

**Covers:**

- Basic legal review and documentation
- Accounting, bookkeeping, and reporting
- Minimal admin tools and services

Kept small on purpose – this is support, not the main event.

---

## 5. Reserve / Buffer (5%)

A small buffer for unexpected but critical needs.

**Covers:**

- Unplanned infra spikes
- Critical bug bounties or emergency fixes
- Adjustments between categories if something proves higher impact than expected

The idea is not to sit on a war chest, but to avoid being forced into bad
decisions if something changes mid-build.

---

## Summary

This round is **build-first**:

- Most of the funds go into **development and an extra dev**, so product
  velocity stays high.
- Marketing, community, and ops are funded enough to support growth, but not
  at the cost of shipping.
- Infra and buffer are sized to keep the project stable without bloating
  overhead.
