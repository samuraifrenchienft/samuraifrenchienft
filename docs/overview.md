# SamuraiFrenchieNFT – Project Overview

**SamuraiFrenchieNFT** is a narrative-driven ecosystem combining:

- A themed **NFT collection**
- A **meme coin** on Base
- A future **duel/game-style app**

## Lore & World

- The story centers on the **Samurai Frenchie** clan in a stylized, Japanese-inspired setting.
- An elite unit called **The Shadow Litter** works in the shadows, specializing in strategy, stealth, and high-risk missions.
- Their main enemies are **frog ninjas**, who appear in raids, battles, and chase scenes (like “The Sprint of the Samurai”).
