## 3. Token Allocation (Detailed)

**Total Supply: 420,760,000 $CHIE'S (100%)**

| Bucket                        | %   | Tokens        |
| ----------------------------- | --- | ------------- |
| Liquidity & Fair Launch       | 83% | 349,230,800   |
| Community / Quests / Airdrops | 6%  | 25,245,600    |
| Promotion                     | 5%  | 21,038,000    |
| Team & Ops                    | 3%  | 12,622,800    |
| Future Investors & Advisors   | 3%  | 12,622,800    |

### 3.1 Liquidity & Fair Launch (83% — 349,230,800 tokens)

- Majority of the supply is added to **DEX liquidity at launch** and released
  into circulating supply.
- LP is planned to be **locked or burned**, enabling trustless trading and
  greatly reducing rug-pull risk.
- No extra minting or stealth tax switches are planned — the launch is meant
  to be as straightforward as possible.

### 3.2 Community / Quests / Airdrops (6% — 25,245,600 tokens)

- Used to reward:
  - Quest participation
  - Social raids and shill campaigns
  - Community art and meme contests
  - Long-term active holders and supporters
- A portion can be available at launch to bootstrap activity, with the rest
  distributed over time to keep incentives flowing and avoid instant dumps.

### 3.3 Promotion (5% — 21,038,000 tokens)

- Dedicated to:
  - KOL / influencer partnerships
  - DEX boosts and launch marketing
  - Cross-project collabs
  - Strategic promotional pushes for visibility
- Usage of this pool should be transparent, with clear announcements for any
  major transaction or campaign.

### 3.4 Team & Ops (3% — 12,622,800 tokens)

- Intended for:
  - Core contributors & maintainers
  - Art, branding, and creative work
  - Technical and dev support
  - Ongoing operational costs (infrastructure, tools, etc.)
- This allocation is meant to be **vested over a longer period** (with a cliff),
  aligning the team with the long-term health of the project instead of short-
  term exit behavior.

### 3.5 Future Investors & Advisors (3% — 12,622,800 tokens)

- Reserved for:
  - Potential angel investors
  - Degen funds
  - Strategic advisors or partners
- If used, deals are expected to have **short, transparent vesting schedules**  
  (for example, 35–50% at TGE and the rest over 1–3 months).
- If not used, this pool can be:
  - Burned, or
  - Redirected to community and ecosystem purposes, depending on how the
    community feels.

## 4. Vesting Philosophy & Examples

$CHIE'S aims to stay as close to a **fair meme launch** as possible, while still
respecting the need for community incentives, marketing, and long-term support.

A reasonable vesting approach looks like this:

### 4.1 Community & Promotion

- Partial unlock at TGE (token generation event) for immediate use.
- Remaining tokens streamed or unlocked over **6–12 months**.
- Goal: keep the project active without dumping the market.

### 4.2 Team & Ops

- **Cliff period:** 6–12 months (no tokens unlocked initially).  
- After the cliff, tokens **vest linearly over 12–24 months**.
- This design aligns the team with the project’s future instead of front-loading
  rewards.

### 4.3 Future Investors & Advisors (If Used)

For potential investors and advisors, the intent is **short degen-style vesting**:

- Example structure:
  - 35–50% at TGE
  - Remaining 50–65% vested over 1–3 months
- Keeps any investor from having a long-lasting heavy unlock over the chart,
  while still rewarding their early backing.

Exact vesting parameters can be finalized and documented once wallets and deals
are confirmed.

## 5. Launch & Liquidity Plan

- Deploy $CHIE'S as an SPL token on Solana.
- Seed a large portion of the supply into **DEX liquidity** (e.g., via Raydium
  and routed by aggregators like Jupiter).
- Ensure **LP is locked or burned** to cement trust in the launch.
- Keep tax mechanics at **0% buy / 0% sell** for a clean trading experience.
- Publish the official token address, LP lock information, and wallets for:
  - Community / Airdrop pool
  - Promotion wallet
  - Team wallet
  - Investor/Advisor wallet (if used)

Transparency around these addresses is critical so the community can track usage
in real time.

## 6. Direction, Culture & Potential Utility

$CHIE'S is **meme-first**. The main focus at launch is:

- Building a recognizable identity and brand
- Fueling raids, memes, and high-energy community content
- Making the chart and community fun to watch and be part of

Potential future directions (not promises, just possibilities):

- NFT integrations or companion collections
- Mini-games, leaderboard events, or on-chain challenges
- Cross-project collabs and ecosystem experiments

The roadmap and “utility” should always respect the core meme culture and not
overpromise things that the team cannot deliver.

---

## 7. Community & Communication

Key principles:

- **Public communication** for major token movements from:
  - Promotion wallet
  - Team wallet
  - Investor/advisor wallet
- Ongoing community events like:
  - Meme contests
  - Art and lore submissions
  - Quest systems and quest platforms
- Open culture: encourage holders and community members to contribute ideas,
  content, and feedback on direction.

## 9. Disclaimer

Nothing in this document is financial advice.

$CHIE'S is a high-risk, highly volatile meme coin. Prices can move quickly and
may go to zero. Always **do your own research** and never spend more than you
can afford to lose.

Holding or interacting with $CHIE'S does not grant ownership, rights, or claims
over any entity, codebase, or team. This is a degen meme project — treat it as
such.
